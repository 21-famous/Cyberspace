📂 GitHub Write-up: OverTheWire Bandit Level 12
Objective: Decompress a file that has been repeatedly compressed using different methods.

📝 Executive Summary
This challenge required the identification and extraction of a data file that had been obfuscated through multiple layers of compression (Gzip, Bzip2, and Tar). This exercise simulates real-world malware analysis where attackers "pack" or "compress" malicious code multiple times to bypass signature-based detection.

🛠️ Technical Analysis & Commands
I utilized the hexdump tool to identify file signatures (Magic Bytes) and renamed files accordingly to allow the correct decompression utilities to run. 

Preparation: Used mkdir /tmp/sankalp_audit to create a workspace and cp data.txt /tmp/sankalp_audit to avoid altering the original file. 
Identification: Ran xxd -r data.txt > data_binary to convert the hex dump back into a binary file. 

The Decompression Loop:
Gzip: Identified by file command; decompressed with mv file file.gz && gunzip file.gz. 
Bzip2: Identified by file command; decompressed with bzip2 -d file. 
Tar: Identified by file command; decompressed with tar -xf file. 

🛡️ Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK

Tactics: Evasion 
Technique: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information. 
Analyst Note: Attackers use these methods to hide their tools from basic security scanners. My ability to manually decompress these layers ensures that I can analyze the "payload" hidden inside. 


💡 Analyst Key Takeaways
Precision: One wrong file extension prevents the decompression tool from working. 
Tooling: Mastered xxd, file, gzip, bzip2, and tar. 
Methodology: Developed a repeatable workflow for analyzing unknown file types, a core skill for Threat Intelligence and Forensics.
