📋 Executive Summary
During this industry-led simulation with Commonwealth Bank, I functioned as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst. The focus was on identifying, analyzing, and disseminating actionable intelligence regarding adversary tactics to protect the bank's digital infrastructure.

🛠️ Core Competencies Demonstrated

Threat Data Analysis: Analyzed raw threat data to identify TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).

Intelligence Lifecycle: Applied the end-to-end intelligence lifecycle to research and monitor threat actor campaigns.

SIEM Proficiency: Utilized Splunk for aggregate log analysis across firewall and network logs to detect anomalous activity.

Technical Reporting: Disseminated intelligence reports and situational awareness to stakeholders during crisis simulations.

🛡️ Technical Deep Dive
1. Adversary Analysis & TTP Identification
Investigated simulated exploitation methods to determine the intent and capability of threat actors.

Mapped findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to categorize adversary behavior.

2. Incident Contextualization
Collaborated with the Security Operations Centre (SOC) and Threat Hunters to provide real-time intelligence support.

Aided in the swift contextualization of threats, allowing for accelerated response and containment.

3. Operational Uplift
Partnered with security teams to update and maintain SOPs, Incident Response playbooks, and operational runbooks.

Supported detection engineers in uplifting security posture based on intelligence-derived insights.

🧠 Key Takeaways

Actionable Intelligence: Learned that intelligence is only valuable if it drives a specific security action or decision.

Stakeholder Communication: Developed the ability to translate complex technical threats into clear, timely communications for non-technical stakeholders during a crisis.
